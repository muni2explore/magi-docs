1. **Single atoms** are like individual LEGO blocks
2. **When atoms stick together**, they make chemicals (like connecting LEGO blocks)
3. **Different combinations** make different chemicals:
   - Water = 2 hydrogen atoms + 1 oxygen atom
   - Salt = 1 sodium atom + 1 chlorine atom  
   - Sugar = lots of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms
4. **Everything around us** is made from these chemical combinations!

So yes, you're absolutely right! Anything made of atoms working together is called a chemical. Even you are made of millions and millions of different chemicals all working together to make... YOU! 

Pretty cool how tiny invisible atoms can build everything we see, right?

## Is it single atom is chemical?

Technically, a single atom by itself is usually called an "element," not a chemical.

- Single atom = `Element` (like a single LEGO block with its own name)
- Two or more atoms together = `Chemical` (like LEGO blocks connected together)
